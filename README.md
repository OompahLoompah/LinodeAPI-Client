# LinodeAPI-Client
What it says on the tin. Real imaginative name, huh?

LinodeAPI-Client is a python library meant for personal projects requiring automated interaction with Linode VPSes. It's mostly built as a learning tool and is almost guaranteed to be incomplete as only calls that I need are implemented. Seriously, programming API calls gets tedious after the tenth near identical call.
